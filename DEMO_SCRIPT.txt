# ðŸŽ¬ MARAHUYO DATING APP - DEMO SCRIPT

## ðŸ“Œ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### A. WALKTHROUGH OF MY APP (Quick Overview)

Marahuyo is a modern, real-time dating application that guides users through a seamless journey from registration to meaningful connections. Users begin by creating an account and building their profile with photos, personal details, and matching preferences. The app then presents curated matches based on age, distance, and preferences, allowing users to like or pass on potential connections. When two users like each other, they can instantly start messaging through real-time chat powered by Stream Chat SDK with live message delivery and online status indicators. The entire experience is wrapped in a beautiful cosmic-themed UI with a dark (Luna) and light (Sol) mode toggle, ensuring a premium, modern feel throughout.

---

### B. OVERVIEW OF MY CODE (Technical Architecture)

The application is built with Next.js 15 and React 19 on the frontend, utilizing Supabase (PostgreSQL) for authentication, database, and storage, while Stream Chat SDK powers real-time messaging. I've implemented a clean architecture with React Context API managing global state (authentication and theme), server actions handling business logic, and reusable components following a modular design pattern. The styling is done with Tailwind CSS v4 with custom CSS variables enabling the dynamic Sol/Luna theme switching without page reloads. The codebase is organized into logical directories (app for pages, components for reusable UI, lib for backend logic), making it easy to navigate, test, and scale as new features are added. Every component uses theme-aware colors and supports responsive design, ensuring a consistent user experience across all devices.

### C. TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS & HOW I'LL ADDRESS THEM (Future Roadmap)

Currently, the app lacks advanced features like email verification, two-factor authentication, and message editingâ€”core security and UX features that I plan to implement in Phase 1 (1-2 months) using Supabase's built-in TOTP support and email templates. The matching algorithm is basic (preference-based filtering only) rather than AI-driven; I'll enhance it with compatibility scoring and machine learning models in Phase 3 to provide smarter recommendations. Infrastructure-wise, there's no caching layer, comprehensive RLS policies, or monitoringâ€”I'll address this by integrating Redis for caching, implementing PostgreSQL Row Level Security, and setting up error tracking with Sentry and performance monitoring with New Relic. Mobile optimization is limited to responsive web design; I plan to build a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support in Phase 3 and eventually develop native iOS/Android apps. The final gap is testingâ€”I'll establish a comprehensive testing suite with Jest, Playwright, and 80%+ code coverage to ensure reliability and prevent regressions as the team scales.

---

### MODULE 2: USER PROFILE MANAGEMENT

**Route:** `/profile/edit` and `/profile`

**Edit Profile Demo:**
Users can upload profile pictures (stored in Supabase Storage), fill in personal information (name, gender, age, bio), add lifestyle details (occupation, education, height, smoking/drinking preferences), and set discovery preferences (age range, distance, gender preferences, relationship goals). The form provides real-time validation and shows a loading state during save. Changes persist immediately to the PostgreSQL database and are reflected across the app.

**View Profile Demo:**
The profile page displays all user information in a read-only format with a beautiful card-based layout, profile picture with glow effects, and sections for basic info, additional details, discovery preferences, and quick action links to edit profile or manage blocked users. The data comes directly from Supabase in real-time, ensuring accuracy. Users can quickly navigate to edit their profile or manage their blocked users list from this view.

---

### MODULE 3: USER DISCOVERY & MATCHING

**Route:** `/discover` and `/discover/list`

**Discover Preferences:**
Users can adjust their matching preferences including age range (with dual sliders), distance radius (0-100+ miles), gender preferences (single or multiple options), and relationship goals (casual, serious, exploring). Each preference card shows current values with easy-to-use controls. The "Save Preferences" button stores changes in real-time to the database.

**Matches List:**
The app displays potential matches as cards showing profile picture, name/age, occupation, bio preview, distance, and action buttons (like, pass, message). Users can quickly browse through matches, and when they like someone, a match is created in the database. If two users like each other, they become a mutual match and can immediately start messaging. The list updates in real-time as new matches become available.

---

### MODULE 4: MESSAGING/CHAT

**Route:** `/chat` and `/chat/[userId]`

**Chat List Page:**
Shows all active conversations with profile pictures, last message preview, timestamp, and unread badges. Users can see online status indicators and last seen times. Clicking a conversation opens the individual chat thread.

**Individual Conversation:**
Users can send and receive messages in real-time with instant delivery and message history. Messages show sender details, timestamp, and are color-coded (user's messages on right in blue, others on left in muted color). The Stream Chat SDK handles all real-time synchronization, ensuring messages arrive instantly across devices. Online status indicators show when the other user is active, and the MessageNotificationListener component handles push notifications for new messages.

---

### MODULE 5: MATCH LIST & BLOCKING

**Route:** `/block`

**Block Management:**
Users can view all blocked users in a list showing profile picture, name/age, occupation, block date, and block reason (if provided). Each blocked user has an "Unblock" button with confirmation. Blocked users cannot see the user's profile, send messages, or appear in matches. This feature gives users full control over their experience and safety.

## B. CODE OVERVIEW

### Architecture Highlights

**Frontend Stack:**
- Next.js 15 with React 19 for modern UI development
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling with custom theme variables
- React Context API for global state management (auth, theme)
- Component-driven architecture with reusable, modular components

**Backend Stack:**
- Supabase for authentication, PostgreSQL database, and file storage
- Stream Chat SDK for real-time messaging and notifications
- Server actions for business logic and data mutations
- Row-level security (RLS) policies for data protection

**Data Flow:**
1. User interactions trigger component handlers
2. Components call server actions or directly use Supabase client
3. Data updates reflect in real-time across all components
4. Theme changes apply globally without page refresh
5. Messages sync instantly via WebSocket (Stream Chat)

**Key Components:**
- `Navbar.tsx` - Navigation with profile dropdown and theme toggle
- `MessageNotificationListener.tsx` - Real-time chat event listener
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Error handling and fallback UI
- Page components organized by feature (auth, profile, discover, chat)

**Styling Approach:**
CSS custom variables define colors for Luna (dark) and Sol (light) themes. Tailwind's `@theme` directive maps these variables to utility classes, enabling consistent, theme-aware styling across all components. Transitions ensure smooth color changes when toggling themes.
